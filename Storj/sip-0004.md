Abstract
--------

The SIP introduces a new RPC method to the Storj protocol to enable renting 
actors on the network to instruct the custodians of their data to modify 
certain contract terms for a given shard.

Motivation
----------

This addition solves two immediate problems:

1. Efficiently renewing existing contracts without the neccessity of publishing 
   entirely new ones to extend the length of storage time.
2. Providing an upgrade path for [HD Identity](sip-0032.md) transfer from a 
   standard Node ID.

Specification
-------------

We propose a new RPC method, `RENEW`, which may be issued to a farming node at 
any time to modify the terms of a contract for which the issuing party is 
authorized. In addition to the standard required parameters, the `RENEW` RPC 
includes 3 more:

* **contract** - the new modified/updated contract data
* **renter_id** - the Node ID authorized for the original contract
* **renter_signature** - the new contract signature by the original Node ID

### Message Format

When a renting node wishes to modify the terms of a given storage contract, 
it issues a `RENEW` RPC message to the farmer including the required 
parameters. Not all contract parameters may be modified in a contract renewal, 
the allowed modifications are limited to:

* **renter_id**
* **renter_hd_key**
* **renter_hd_index**
* **renter_signature**
* **store_begin**
* **store_end**

Recipient farmers must take care to validate the modifications to prevent loss 
of future payments. In the example below, a renting node is instructing the 
farming node to transfer the authorization/ownership to a new SIP32 based 
identity as well as extending the contract period by an additional 90 days.

}
```

Upon receipt of a `RENEW` RPC, the farmer must inspect the contract and 
perform a local lookup of any contracts associated with the given `data_hash`. 
If a contract is found for the shard and the original `renter_id`, then the 
farmer must verify the signature from the original identity and validate the 
contract modifications - including signature verification for the new identity.

If these checks pass, the farmer must sign the new contract and respond to the 
request with it's updated copy after updating it's own local record.

    "contract": {
      "version": 0,

  },
  "id": "7b6a2ab35da6826995abf3310a4875097df88cdb"
}
```

Upon receipt of the response, the renting node, must update it's local record 
of the storage contract once more, to include the updated signature from the 
farming node. Once this exchange is completed, the contract has been 
successfully transferred and/or renewed.
